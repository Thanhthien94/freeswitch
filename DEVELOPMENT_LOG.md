## üêõ Issues & Resolutions

### Resolved Issues

#### Issue #1: CORS Blocking API Calls
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** Frontend unable to call NestJS API due to CORS restrictions  
**Root Cause:** Helmet security middleware blocking cross-origin requests  
**Resolution:** Disabled Helmet temporarily, configured CORS properly  
**Prevention:** Implement proper CORS configuration in production  

#### Issue #2: Docker Networking Problems
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Server Actions calling wrong URLs (localhost:3002 instead of nestjs-api:3000)  
**Root Cause:** Environment variables not properly configured for Docker networking  
**Resolution:** Updated docker-compose.yml with correct internal service names  
**Prevention:** Better environment variable documentation  

#### Issue #3: NextJS Authentication Pattern Confusion
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Mixed patterns between old client-side auth and new Server Actions  
**Root Cause:** Lack of understanding of NextJS 15 official patterns  
**Resolution:** Researched official documentation, implemented proper patterns  
**Prevention:** Follow official documentation strictly  

### Open Issues
- None currently

## üîç Technical Decisions Log

### Decision #1: NextJS 15 Server Actions vs Route Handlers
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Decision:** Use Server Actions for authentication, Route Handlers for complex API proxying  
**Rationale:** Official NextJS 15 pattern, better performance, simpler code  
**Impact:** Cleaner architecture, better security, easier maintenance  

### Decision #2: Stateless vs Database Sessions
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Decision:** Stateless sessions with JWT + HttpOnly cookies  
**Rationale:** Better scalability, simpler deployment, NextJS 15 recommendation  
**Impact:** No session storage needed, easier horizontal scaling  

### Decision #3: Docker Bridge vs Host Networking
**Date:** July 11, 2025  
**Decision:** Bridge networking with port mapping  
**Rationale:** Better security, proper isolation, external SIP access  
**Impact:** Successful external SIP client connections
