# This file ensures the backups directory is tracked in Git
# while actual backup data remains excluded by .gitignore

# The backups directory structure is needed for:
# - backup-current-data.sh script functionality
# - Migration workflow between hosts
# - Proper directory permissions and setup

# Production backup data is excluded via .gitignore:
# - backups/*/  (all timestamped subdirectories)
# - *.sql, *.csv, *.tar.gz files

# Only tracked files in backups/:
# - README.md (documentation)
# - .gitkeep (this file)
